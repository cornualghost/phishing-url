# Phishing or Legitimate
**Phishing Detection with Machine Learning: A Deep Dive** 🛡️

**Understanding the Threat:**  
Phishing is a deceptive technique used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into disclosing sensitive information. This is achieved through emails that mimic legitimate sources, directing recipients to fraudulent websites that look strikingly similar to their real counterparts. Unlike complex cyber attacks that require breaking through security measures, phishing exploits human trust. 📧

**The Evolution of Phishing:**  
As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, they now employ SSL protections on phishing sites, making them appear secure and legitimate. This evolution has blurred the lines between safe and malicious sites, presenting a challenge for users and security systems alike. 🚨

**The Role of Machine Learning:**  
In response to these evolving threats, machine learning (ML) emerges as a powerful tool in detecting and preventing phishing attempts. ML algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of phishing. 🧠

**Detection Techniques:**  
1. **URL Analysis:** ML algorithms scrutinize URLs, looking for suspicious patterns such as unfamiliar domain names or misleading subdomains. This analysis includes examining the structure, the use of secure protocols, and the overall composition of the URL to flag potential threats. 🔍
2. **Content Inspection:** Beyond URLs, ML dives into the content of web pages. It evaluates the HTML code for unusual patterns, such as the presence of fake login forms or unexpected redirects. This thorough examination helps in identifying web pages that are designed to deceive. 🕵️‍♂️

Our project is dedicated to leveraging ML for more effective phishing detection. By combining detailed URL and content analysis, we aim to create a system that accurately identifies and flags phishing websites.
